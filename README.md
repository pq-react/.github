### _Facilitating the transition to post-quantum cryptography across diverse infrastructures_

PQ-REACT (Post Quantum Cryptography Framework for Energy Aware Contexts) is a #HorizonEurope funded project that tackles the challenge of transitioning from classical to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). The project focuses on developing a cryptographic framework that supports secure migration paths, cryptographic agility, and validation tools to enable a seamless transition to quantum-resistant security solutions 



This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under grant agreement N° 101119547.
